# Image-and-Video-captioning

This repository contains a project that explores the task of image captioning using Vision Transformers (ViTs). The project aims to generate descriptive captions for images as well as videos by combining the power of Transformers and computer vision. It leverages state-of-the-art pre-trained ViT models to generate accurate and contextually relevant captions.
